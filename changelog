General:
* Provide a UI, where almost all color settings can be changed. Allow more colors to be customized.
* Improve the UI for editing "Editor syntax highlight themes".
* Improve multi monitor support for the info window popup.
* Several bug fixed with the Global compiler variables.
* Fix bug "Ticking any checkbox in the File properties dialog cause the file to be made read-only".
* Allow more strings to be translated.
* Improvements/bugfixes to the Find/Replace feature.
* Improvements to the annoying dialog.
* Add two more terminal presets: xfce_terminal and terminology.
* Improvements/bugfixes for "Start here page".
* Improvements to the editor - new commands, fixes to old commands, etc.
* Make strip trailing blanks to preserve active line of active editor (fix bug #18845) .
* Try to make visible all toolbars, when a toolbar is shown/hidden and add menu option to fit and optimize the toolbars.
* Improve "swap header/source" command by adding a case-insensitive search as fallback.

Code Completion:
* Fix several crashes.
* Fix several parsing bugs.
* Add pseudo semantic highlight feature - recognises class members and styles them differently (disabled by default).
* Don't place the calltip outside of the editor window (this should be modified to not place it outside the monitor, instead).
* Don't place the calltip over the cursor.

Compiler:
* All default compiler options (flag checkboxes, regexes, file extensions, etc) are stored in XML.
* (Optional) warning messages if multiple compiler options are unwise to use together (but still legal).
* Automatic disabling of mutually exclusive compiler options.
* Options to add, edit, and remove compiler flag checkboxes through the GUI.
* Compiler options are saved back to XML if they are modified (in <user_data>/CodeBlocks/compilers); the resulting files can be shared.
* Dynamic loading of pure XML defined compilers (simple auto-detection routines available).
* Automatically filter C and C++ exclusive flags.
* New compiler interfaces defined for: LLVM Clang, IAR ARM, Keil C51, and IAR ICC8051.
* Add registry based autodetection of TDM-GCC.
* Make the gcc compiler be a bit more robust, when making static libraries.
* Don't clear logs before run.

Debugger:
* The locals and function arguments have been reimplemented.
* Bug fixes for parsing watches.
* Allow the user to control which watches should be updated automatically and which shouldn't.
* Allow breakpoints to work, when using C::B under Wine;
